At the core of it, phishing involves tricking a user into doing something they shouldn't do. Also, not all phishing techniques involve tricking a user into clicking a malicious link on an email, entering their credentials on a phishing site or downloading a malicious file.

The primary goal for phishing is either to get shells and/or credentials. Many techniques exist for shell phishing and maybe in upcoming blogs I'll look into CSRF, XSS, HTML smuggling and the most common technique, maldocs. However in this article, we'll be focusing on credential phishing with evilginx and gophish.

From the [official documentation](https://docs.getgophish.com/user-guide/what-is-gophish), Gophish is a phishing framework that makes the simulation of real-world phishing attacks dead-simple. Gophish is also free, accessible and really easy to use. [Evilginx](https://github.com/kgretzky/evilginx2), a tool written by [@mrgretzky](https://twitter.com/mrgretzky), on the other hand, is a man-in-the-middle attack framework used for phishing login credentials along with session cookies, which in turn allows us to bypass 2-factor authentication protection.

Even though Gophish has a fully functional capability to collect credentials, it only works if the login page is static and doesn't necessarily have 2FA/MFA set. This is where evilginx comes in. Evilginx works as a relay/proxy between the real website and the target. As the target interacts with the real site, evilginx captures all the data, including the session cookies, being transmitted between the two parties.

![[how_evilginx_works.png]](/assets/img/gophish/how-evilginx-works.png)

We'll integrate the ease of phishing with Gophish and the man-in-the-middle functionality of evilginx to create a robust phishing campaign that is able to collect session cookies/tokens and login credentials from applications that have 2FA enabled.

### Prerequisites

For this demonstration, we'll need:

1. One domain to be assigned to your evilginx server.
2. A fully functional SMTP server. Gophish will use the SMTP details from the SMTP server you set up. In this demonstration, we'll use SendGrid as our SMTP server. However, in red team assessments, it is best to have complete control over your infrastructre rather than using third party services.
3. Two VPSs for both Gophish and evilginx. 1GB RAM for each works just fine.

### Process

1. We'll start by installing Gophish on the first VPS and populating all the necessary sections.
2. Get and use a SendGrid account as our SMTP server.
3. Install evilginx and create a link that we'll use to lure the target into clicking.
4. Integrate the link into Gophish and send the email.
5. Wait for the target to click on our link.

#### 1. Gophish Installation

Gophish is pretty easy to install but there are a few gotchas. We'll begin by downloading the zip file, unzipping it and launching the executable.

```shell
wget https://github.com/gophish/gophish/releases/download/v0.11.0/gophish-v0.11.0-linux-64bit.zip
unzip gophish-v0.11.0-linux-64bit.zip -d gophish  
cd gophish  
chmod +x gophish  
```

Because Gophish by default listens on port 80, running the executable requires root permissions. Before we run gophish, we do have to edit the `config.json` file which holds the configuration settings for gophish. The only thing we'll change is the `admin_server.listen_url` value from the localhost IP to that of your VPS.

It should look like this:

![[json.png]](/assets/img/gophish/json2.png)

**OPTIONAL:** You can choose to have your admin server available over HTTPS by creating an SSL certificate and private keys by using the following command:

```shell
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout gophish.key -x509 -days 365 -out gophish.crt
```

Answer the questions generated by the CSR process but since this is a local self-signed certificate the details are not that important. After the process is over, it will create the certificate file and the key - `gophish.crt` and `gophish.key`. Move both files into the gophish root directory, where the config.json is located and edit the `config.json` file as follows:

![[json-edit.png]](/assets/img/gophish/json-edit2.png)

Now we can launch gophish.

```shell
sudo ./gophish
```

Port 80 will host you phishing site and port 3333 allows you to connect to your admin console. Once we run, we see that gophish is running on <https://IP.of.our.VPS:3333>. We also get auto-generated credentials that we can use to access the server.

![[launch.png]](/assets/img/gophish/launch.png)

Launch gophish using the link and accept the certificate warning. Login using the credentials generated. It will prompt you to change your password. After that is successful, we'll get to Gophish's Dashboard.

![[dashboard.png]](/assets/img/gophish/dashboard.png)

To complete our campaign, we need to setup a few things:

1. **Users & Groups** which is the list of users you want to phish, including emails, names, and titles. Add one email that you have control over.

![[users.png]](/assets/img/gophish/users.png)

2. An **email template** which is the actual email we want to send, in HTML, text or both. We'll get to this a little later.

![[template.png]](/assets/img/gophish/template.png)

3. The **Landing page** which is the page that our targets are sent to and interact with, if they click the link. In our case, this is the link we'll generate with evilginx.

![[landing.png]](/assets/img/gophish/landing.png)

4. The **Sending Profile** which is the actual email server (SendGrid, in our scenario), and the settings which allow our phish to be sent. We'll get to this in the next step.

![[sending.png]](/assets/img/gophish/sending.png)

5. After all that is setup, we can finally schedule and launch our **Campaign**.

![[campaign.png]](/assets/img/gophish/campaign.png)

#### 2. Setting Up SendGrid as our SMTP Server

In order to send to send our phishing emails, we'll need to either set up a mail server or use a third party option. For this demonstration, we'll use SendGrid which is a third party [SMTP relay](https://babligan.github.io/posts/smtp-relaying-for-phishing/). The advantage that SendGrid offers is that is free, you don't need to put your credit card details and you'll be using your relay's provider servers which have an established reputation on most spam filters. Additionally, you can use port 587 for SMTP even if outbound port 25 is blocked by your VPS provider. (Looking at you, Vultr) The biggest downside is that to send a decent amount of emails, you'll need to pay.

First things first, register an account. In order to send our first email, we need to create a sender identity.

![[sender.png]](/assets/img/gophish/sender.png)

Enter your details. In my case I entered the same email address in the 'From Email Address' and 'Reply To'. Basically I just emailed myself to verify my email address as the source address. I also used fake addresses generated by this [site](https://www.fakeaddressgenerator.com/). Once you are done, click 'Create'.

![[id.png]](/assets/img/gophish/id.png)

Head over to your email address, click on the verification link and if it's successful, you should receive a congratulatory message.

![[verified.png]](/assets/img/gophish/verify.png)

Next, we'll get our SMTP Relay credentials. To do that, we'll click on the 'Start' button under the 'Integrate using our Web API or SMTP Relay'.

![[start.png]](/assets/img/gophish/start.png)

 We'll select the SMTP Relay option.
 
![[smtp.png]](/assets/img/gophish/smtp.png)

Here, the important thing is to create a key. Give a name to your key and create it. Once that's done, your key will be generated.

![[api.png]](/assets/img/gophish/api.png)

Back to Gophish's Sending Profile. The configurations generated by SendGrid will correspond to the settings we use on our Sending Profile. Essentially, our sending profile will look like this:

- **Username**: the username generated by SendGrid
- **Password**: your API key.
- **Host**: The SMTP server configuration that you take from sendgrid.
- **From**: the sending email address.

![[profile.png]](/assets/img/gophish/profile.png)

Let's test whether this configuration is correctly set by sending a test email.

![[test.png]](/assets/img/gophish/test.png)

It works!

![[works.png]](/assets/img/gophish/works.png)

When we check our email:

![[sent.png]](/assets/img/gophish/sent.png)

#### 3. Installing and Running evilginx2

We will install evilginx on the second server. The official usage and installation of evilginx are available on the tool's official [Github project page](https://github.com/kgretzky/evilginx2). Before installing evilginx, we have to install Go of at least version 1.14.0.

To do so, follow these steps:

```shell
wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.16.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go && sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.16.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
source $HOME/.profile
```

Finally verify that you have GO installed.

```shell
go version
```

When you have GO installed, type in the following:

```shell
sudo apt-get -y install git make
git clone https://github.com/kgretzky/evilginx2.git
cd evilginx2
make
```

If you get this error, export the PATH variable again and reload bash.

![[error.png]](/assets/img/gophish/error.png)

Now that we have evilginx installed, let's run it. To do so run:

```shell
sudo ./bin/evilginx -p ./phishlets/
```

**IMPORTANT:** Ensure that there's no service running on ports TCP 443, TCP 80 and UDP 53. You may need to shutdown apache or nginx and any service used for resolving DNS that may be running. evilginx2 will tell you on launch if it fails to open a listening socket on any of these ports.

![[first-run.png]](/assets/img/gophish/first-run.png)

If you get this error, you'll want to check what service is using port 53 (it should be your default DNS resolver, so we just need to stop it and let evilginx run it's own in-built DNS server.)

```shell
sudo lsof -i :53
```

![[lsof.png]](/assets/img/gophish/lsof.png)

Then we'll stop it either by stopping the service or killing it using its PID then edit the resolv.conf file to use Google's DNS servers. If the echo command doesn't work, use nano or vim instead.

```shell
sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved
rm /etc/resolv.conf
echo 'nameserver 8.8.8.8' > /etc/resolv.conf
```

When we restart evilginx, it should be fine.

![[second-run.png]](/assets/img/gophish/second-run.png)

The next step is the configuration of Evilginx. You have to specify the domain name and the IP address of your server:

```shell
config domain domain-name.com
config ip 1.2.3.4
```

![[config.png]](/assets/img/gophish/config.png)

Evilginx creates phishing links using phishlets. A phishlet is a YAML file that contains configuration to phish a specific website. You can access all the pre-defined phishlets at `/evilginx/phishlets` or you could view the available phishlets by typing `phishlets`.

![[phishlets.png]](/assets/img/gophish/phishlets.png)

To activate a phishlet, run the following command:
`phishlets hostname <phishlet> <hostname>` where the hostname is our domain. In our case, we want to use the outlook phishet. Therefore:

```shell
phishlets hostname outlook domain-name.com
```

![[activate.png]](/assets/img/gophish/activate.png)

For Evilginx to work correctly as a proxy, you will also have to configure the same sub-domains. To know which sub-domains are required, type:

```shell
phishlets get-hosts outlook
```

![[gethosts.png]](/assets/img/gophish/gethosts.png)

We have 3 subdomains to register: outlook, login and account. We'll register these using CNAME records on our domain registrar. On our hosting site (I'm using namechep, but the configuration is usually the same across registrars), we'll register 4 DNS records. The first will be an A record which points to the IP address of our VPS and the rest will be CNAME records for our sub-domains. One thing to note here, we don’t need to copy the `domain-name.com` part, we just need the preceding string.

![[dns.png]](/assets/img/gophish/dns.png)

Once your records have resolved (it usually takes less than 3 minutes or you could confirm with [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org)), we can continue with enabling our phish. To do so we run:

```shell
phishlets enable outlook
```

When enabling a phishlet, Evilginx will try to request SSL certificates from LetsEncrypt for the different sub-domains.

![[enable.png]](/assets/img/gophish/enable2.png)

Now that our phish is enabled, we'll generate a lure which is basically the link that a target clicks on. The lures have to be attached with our desired phishlet and a redirect has to be set to point towards the legitimate website that we are trying to harvest credentials for, otherwise they'll be rickrolled.

```shell
lures create outlook
lures edit 0 redirect_url https://outlook.live.com/owa/?nlp=1
lures get-url 0
```

![[lures.png]](/assets/img/gophish/lures2.png)

If you wanted to change the hostname of your lure you'd use one of the subdomains that we registered and set it as follows:

```shell
lures edit 0 hostname login.domain-name.com
```

Then you can go head and get the URL associated with the new hostname.

```shell
lures get-url 0
```

Once a target clicks on our URL, they will be sent to our phishlet. And when they enter the correct credentials, we can capture them and redirect them to the right location.

![[creds.png]](/assets/img/gophish/creds2.png)

Now that we've verified that everything works, let's tie it all together. The captured token can be imported into a browser with the EditThisCookie extension for example. By adding the cookie, the authentication is completely bypassed (even the 2FA) and the attacker has a complete access to the victim's account.

![[sessions2.png]](/assets/img/gophish/sessions2.png)

#### 4. Create and Deploy our Phish

Back to Gophish's email template and now we can craft the email we want to send our target. I'll use a simple template from [crigg626 Github repo](https://github.com/criggs626/PhishingTemplates). I'll use the [Webmail Upgrade](https://github.com/criggs626/PhishingTemplates/blob/master/emails/Upgrade%20Webmail.html) template but feel free to use whichever one.

![[final-template.png]](/assets/img/gophish/final-template.png)

Just to make sure that it would land, I edited the href tag in the HTML code to point to our evilginx link.

![[href.png]](/assets/img/gophish/href.png)

To integrate our evilginx link, we'll edit our Landing page and import the link.

![[final-landing.png]](/assets/img/gophish/final-landing.png)
![[import.png]](/assets/img/gophish/import.png)

After we've checked that all sections have been filled correctly, we can finally launch our campaign.

![[final-campaign.png]](/assets/img/gophish/final-campaign.png)

When we check our email, we find it. Yay!

![[email.png]](/assets/img/gophish/email.png)

When we click the link it opens a new tab, which is the outlook login page we had setup with evilginx. (you might have to clear your browser cache or use a different browser entirely). We sign in with some dummy creds and we are able to retrieve them on our evilginx server.

![[redirect.png]](/assets/img/gophish/redirect.png)
![[sessions.png]](/assets/img/gophish/sessions.png)

### Improvements

1. To make the phishing email even more effective, you can choose to integrate it with a technique that is able to yield a shell. XSS, Maldocs, CSRF, HTML smuggling and many others can work.
2. For OPSEC, it is best to use infrastructure that you have complete control over. So, instead of using SendGrid, you can use your own mail server.
3. Ensure that you use TLS on **ALL** your phishing infrastructure which includes Gophish's listening server.

### Mitigation

1. For this type of attack, the primary defense would always be exercising a little bit of paranoia. **Always check the legitimacy of the domain that's visible on the address bar.**
2. However, this wouldn't be enough for big companies as it just requires one  user to submit their correct credetials and just like that attackers are able to steal large amounts of data. This is where U2F for unphishable 2nd factor authentication comes in. It uses a physical hardware that you plug into a USB port and you just press a button when the website asks you to. The U2F protocol is designed to take the website's domain as one of the key components in negotiating the handshake. This means that if the domain in the browser's address bar, does not match the domain used in the data transmission between the website and the U2F device, the communication will simply fail. This solution leaves no room for error and is totally unphishable using Evilginx method.
